# AttentionDefender

I'm easily distracted and will load sites like reddit as a matter of
habit.  AttentionDefender is a tiny userscript that delays loading of
selected sites for 10s, giving you a chance to rethink that
distraction and get back to work.  It's more convenient than a hard
block (e.g via DNS) and if you wait for the page to load it will not
be delayed again during this session.

Requires use of userscript extension for your browser like
[TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) (for Chrome) or
[Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) (for Firefox).
