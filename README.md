# AttentionDefender

I'm easily distracted and will load sites like reddit as a matter of
habit.  AttentionDefender is a tiny userscript that delays loading of
selected sites for 10s, giving you a chance to rethink that
distraction and get back to work.  It's more convenient than a hard
block (e.g a DNS blackhole) and if you wait for the page to load it
will not be delayed again during this session.

Requires use of userscript extension for your browser like
[TamperMonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/) (for Chrome) or
[Greasemonkey](http://www.greasespot.net/) (for Firefox).

Configuration is entirely through the "User Includes" field of the
script settings.  Mine has:
